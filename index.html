                    <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>I grew up in Sonoma County, California. Spending a lot of time outdoors and hanging out with neighborhood friends, but I was always interested in computers and gaming.
                            I thought it was SO cool that a small box could display all these fun things, but none of it made sense to me. I grew up, and my interest was short-lived.
                            I started playing volleyball and went to college on a scholarship. However, in college, the computer science spark was reignited and I started taking some CS courses to minor in.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>Three courses later, I found myself at a very difficult decision. My CS Minor was taking valuable time away from my sport, my Major courses, and my friends.
                            It became unmanagable, so I ultimately dropped my CS Minor. Flash forward to me working as a Marketing Coordinator at a company, where my interest in CS was
                            once again ignited as I got to work with HTML. After two years and many existential crises later, I realized my passion might just be coding, so here I am! </p>

                            on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I 
                            make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>
